# modern-k8s-microservice

This was an over-engineering in most of my previous projects, but studying widely used stacks won't hurt.

## Stacks
- Microservices on a Kubernetes cluster (Docker Desktop or Minikube)
- Istio Service Mesh
- GRPC
- Kafka
- Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Jaeger, Kiali

## Goals
- Implement simple functionalities that can be used in a game service.
- Track requests and responses between services.
- Implement failover and retry mechanisms.
- Monitor services and the cluster.
