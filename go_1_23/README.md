# go_1_23

This is a test of the changes introduced in Go 1.22 to 1.23 that seem useful.

- [range functions](https://tip.golang.org/blog/range-functions)
- [for loop](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.22#language)
- [math/rand/v2](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.22#math_rand_v2)

[Enhanced routing patterns](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.22#enhanced_routing_patterns) also seems very useful,
but I mostly use third-party libraries for developing web services.
